#+TITLE: json2nd

* Overview

Filter to convert a JSON document with a top-level array to NDJSON (a.k.a NLJSON, new-line delimited JSON), which is generally much easier to work with, especially for a large file.

#+begin_src sh
  cat large_array.json | json2nd > object_per_line.json
#+end_src

If the top level of the JSON is not an array then the filter is a no-op by default and will just re-produce the input.

#+begin_src sh
  echo "{}" | json2nd > object.json
#+end_src

** Windows style line endings ("\r\n")?

Maybe. Honesly would be getting beyond the simplicity of this thing, but I can see how it could be useful to some people. Bug me?
