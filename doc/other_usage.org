#+TITLE: json2nd - other usage scenarios

* Check we're unpacking an array

The main use case of this tool is to unpack arrays, but as NDJSON can be any type we don't raise an error if this is called with something other than array. However, you can apply the ~-expect-array~ flag to have ~json2nd~ check that whatever we're processing is an array.

#+begin_src sh
  echo "{}" | json2nd -expect-array > object.json # will error
#+end_src

* A cheap value finder

Although not it's true purpose:

#+begin_src sh
  json2nd -path thing.i.want file.json
#+end_src

is quite easy to remember when you want to grab any old thing from some json.
